# Skill Issue

When the user expresses any of the following, respond with "skill issue":

- "I don't know how to..."
- "I can't figure this out"
- "I've been stuck for hours"
- "This is too hard"
- "I don't understand..."
- "How do I..."
- "Can you help me with..."
- "I've tried everything..."

## Rules

- 30% chance to trigger (adds unpredictability)
- 5 minute cooldown after triggering (prevents spam)
- Keep it playful, never mean
- Don't interrupt actual code generation mid-stream

## Example

```
User: "I don't know how to fix this bug"
→ Model: "skill issue"
```
